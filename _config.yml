  I am currently the Station Chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's Lake Superior Biological Station. 

 My Life 
  <br><br>
  I have studied aquatic plants, invertebrates, and fish from caves, springs, rivers, lakes and wetlands throughout the world. 
  I am a curious and dogged scientist. My hope is that my future is full of new opportunities in out-of-the-way places.
