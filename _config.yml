  Hello, Bonjour, and Hola, <br>
  Welcome to my personal site. A few things you should know about me: I find joy in Border Collies, fish, leftovers, 3rd hand clothes, snow, bikes, and data visualization; I am the Station Chief of the U.S. Geological Survery's Lake Superior Biological Station in Ashland, Wisconsin; I live at the end of a dirt road.
